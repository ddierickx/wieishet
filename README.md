What?
-----

A simple Christmas present lottery game, based on an older kids game. Written in about 2 hours so a bit quick-and-dirty...


How does it work?
-----------------

Two random people are chosen at the beginning, say Bob and Emma.

Bob will pick one of the people he bought a present for and will answer yes/no questions from Emma on who this person is.

Emma will guess that person by exhaustion and a funny Christmas picture of that person pops up! Hooray!

Enjoy!
